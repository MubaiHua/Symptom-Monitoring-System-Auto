<!-- ABOUT -->
## üê± About

**UCLA CAT** (Covid-symptom-survey Auto-filling Tool) is an automation software that frees UCLA bruins from the annoying daily routine of manually filling out the [Covid Symptom Survey](https://uclasurveys.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aeH9BFhYVjkYTsO) to show your healthy status.

One click of UCLA CAT completes the survey for you as a healthy status for today. You can schedule the UCLA CAT to run every day at midnight, so you always get a pretty green screen wherever you go.

Here is a demo of how the survey auto-filling runs:
